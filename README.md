## Project description

Covid-19 disease (infectious disease causes by SARS-CoV-2) might increase the chance of having inflammatory and vascular events in children. Previous research has demonstrated the link between Covid-19 and subsequent vascular events in adults, but little is known about this link in children. Furthermore, there are reports of inflammatory diseases post SARV-CoV-2 infection in children such as the Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. Higher risk of inflammatory diseases post Covid-19 needs to be quantified in children.

They have been concerns about higher risk of myocarditis/pericarditis post Covid-19 vaccination in general population and there were reported cases of venous and arterial blood clots in unusual locations, such as the cerebral veins, low platelet levels, as well as inflammation of the heart, after various doses of COVID-19 vaccination. We need to better understand whether this is of concern in children.

We will study children alive in NHS England and Wales during the pandemic. First, we will follow children from the beginning of the pandemic in January 2020 and identify whether they had any record of Covid-19 disease. We will explore the relationship between Covid-19 and subsequent vascular and inflammatory events in those children. In other words, we will compare the number of children with events and a diagnosis of Covid-19 to the number with events and without Covid-19 diagnosis for a list of vascular and inflammatory diseases. Second, we will follow children from August 2021 and explore whether they have been vaccinated against Covid-19. We will explore whether vaccination leads to higher risk of vascular and inflammatory diseases in children.

Different children may have different risks, so we will look at children of different age group, ethnicities, and medical history.

This information is needed so that we can better plan health care provision and prevention for children post-Covid-19 infection and according to their vaccination status.
